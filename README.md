# Work Day Scheduler 

I first had to go through the html and format everything to my liking.
After that I started incorporating the functionality aspect of things through javascript and jquery.
I added the ability to save edit and reload tasks.
Then I set up a system to help you determine when that task needed to be completed. The task block changes colors according to the current time of the day.
